# Arizona State University

This repository contains coursework from a machine learning and artificial intelligence certificate completed through Arizona State University.

The main files are jupyter notebooks consisting of the following:
- [bayesian machine learning](https://github.com/Joshua-Robison/ASU/blob/main/src/bayes_model.ipynb)
- [kMeans clustering methods](https://github.com/Joshua-Robison/ASU/blob/main/src/clustering_model.ipynb)
- [dynamic bayesian networks](https://github.com/Joshua-Robison/ASU/blob/main/src/dynamic_bayes_network.ipynb)
- [convolutional neural networks](https://github.com/Joshua-Robison/ASU/blob/main/src/cnn_model.ipynb)

### Bayesian Learning
This example looks at binary classification. It uses the MNIST dataset (images 0 and 1) and Bayes formula to classify images.

### K-Means Clustering
This example builds a k-means clustering model from scratch. It looks at different initialization methods to improve performance.

### Dynamic Bayes
This example looks at a simple probabilistic problem and constructs a dynamic bayesian model to compute probabilities over time.

### Convolutional Neural Network
This example builds a CNN model from scratch. It is used on the MNIST image dataset.
